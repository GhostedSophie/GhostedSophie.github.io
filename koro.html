      Koro Sensei is the main character of the anime and manga series
      <span class="italic">Assassination Classroom</span>. He is an extremely powerful creature who threatens to destroy the Earth but offers humanity a chance to avoid this fate—by becoming the homeroom teacher of Class 3-E at Kunugigaoka Junior High School.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      Despite being an apparent threat to the planet, Koro Sensei turns out to be an incredible teacher who truly cares for his students and helps them grow academically, emotionally, and personally. His speed is Mach 20, and he possesses a variety of near-supernatural abilities that make him virtually unkillable.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      His name, "Koro Sensei", comes from a student pun—"korosenai sensei" (殺せない先生), meaning "unkillable teacher". Koro Sensei hides a tragic past, and his real identity and motivations are slowly revealed throughout the story.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg">
      With his cheerful smile, tentacled body, and heartfelt dedication to his students, Koro Sensei has become an iconic and beloved character in anime history.
